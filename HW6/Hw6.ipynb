    "### Matrix stuff\n",
    "1. Augmented Matrix\n",
    "This is basically a matrix that is a system of linear equations that its right most column contains the solution, and the columns before that are the respective coeffcients to the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity sakes,  the augmented matrix is formed by appending the column of constants to the coefficient matrix of a linear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consistent linear system.\n",
    "A system with a solution, conversely a non-consitent linear system has no solution. \n",
    "A solution to a system of equations represents a set of values that satisfy all equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Row operations vs col operations\n",
    "- Row operations: Affect entire rows, preserving row equivalence.\n",
    "- Column operations: Affect individual columns, changing the systemâ€™s structure.\n",
    "4. Linear indpendence\n",
    "\n",
    "This just means there is one solution to the  of the Av=0\n",
    "Where v is the trivial solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of saying this, is no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is a linear combination?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply multipling vectors and adding them up to create a new vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the rank of a matrix?\n",
    "This seems like silly matrix jargon for the number of columns of a linearly indpendent matrix.\n",
    "So the rank is the Dim of a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What does it mean to be a span?\n",
    "A span is simply is the set of linear independent vectors in a sub vector space.\n",
    "Meaning if we are in the 2-d world, the span of most pair of 2d vectors is all of 2d space.\n",
    "Thinking about it another way.\n",
    "x$v_1$ + y$w$ where we can make any combinatins with multiplying vector $v$ with some constant and adding it with vector $w$ times some constant.\n",
    "In that frame it is easy to imagine \"spanning\" across a space.\n",
    "Note when 2-d vectors line up, they are all vectors that line up on a certain line. So they are still in 2d, but only span a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note something that is helpful, is the fact that if we have 2 vectors in a 3-d space, their span will be a plane in the 2-d space.\n",
    "You can also have three vectors in a 3-d space, but then they span the entire space, again, unless two or more of the three vectors are the same vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is linearly dependent mean?\n",
    "In some sense this just mean, that you have one vector that in the same of other vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is a sub space of a matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A subspace of $R^n$ is any set of vectors that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the basis of a matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the dimension of a matrix?\n",
    "The number of linearly independent vectors.\n",
    "Moral of the story here, you cannot have less vectors than dimensions.\n",
    "Also every basis has the same number, which is the dimension of the sub-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Connection of independence, basis and dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a bunch of independent vectors, then you are saying you cannot reduce any of the vectors, or two of those vectors are equivilent.\n",
    "They are all unique and their combinations are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis is a subspace of a vector basis. It maybe the subspace of a set of linearly independent vectors.\n",
    "The number of those vectors is the dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, something easy to confuse.\n",
    "If you have a basis of dimension of 2, it does not mean $R^2$.\n",
    "It can be a plane in $R^3$ with a dimension of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors stuff\n",
    "5. Vector work\n",
    " - Dot product meaning in 2d\n",
    " Do product can be calculated in two ways.\n",
    " One is simply multiplying the values, like $x_1 y_1 + .... +x_n y_n$. Also another way is taking the magnitude of $x$ and $y$ then multiplying by $\\cos \\theta$. Basically a proption in directionality of each other times the magnitudes.\n",
    " - Expanding a vector\n",
    " Simply just multiply it by a scaler. It expands the entire vector in each direction.\n",
    " - Reflecting a vector\n",
    " This is more intresting. It is easy to think about this in 2-d. Also one has to consider, reflecting around what? Say some axis. I think the easiest way is thinking about this in a 2-d world, having some axis as the relfection point, attaining the angle between the axis and vector, then recreating the vector with that. \n",
    " - Vectors relation to cose and sine\n",
    "Note not mentioned, but semi important is the relationship of an angle and vector. We can describe a vector via $x_1$ and $y_1$ or we can describe the vector as $\\sqrt {x_1 ^2 + y_1 ^2} *  \\cos \\theta$\n",
