    "My intuition would be to do something like, to draw random samples for x, then random samples for y (the range).\n",
    "Then for each pair of random numbers we sampled, we plug in f(x) and see if our random y is above or below that.\n",

A partial derivative is like taking a slice through this surface to see how the function changes along a particular direction, either along the x-axis or the y-axis, while keeping the other variable constant. In essence, it tells us how the function is changing with respect to one variable at a time.\n",
    "In the Taylor series formula, each term involves a partial derivative of the function evaluated at the center point. These partial derivatives capture how the function changes with respect to each variable independently. By combining these partial derivatives in the Taylor series, we can approximate the function's behavior in a multi-dimensional space.\n",
